This directory can be used for creating models for PredictDB with GTEx data.

These models can be used to predict gene expression in 44 different tissues, based on individual
genotype.  To train the models, we used version 6 of the GTEx data and applied 10-fold cross
validation elastic-net within SNPs that are located within 1mb of the gene as features.

The pipeline takes 4 different sets of inputs (all in the data/inputs/ directory, possibly in the
form of symbolic links), does some preprocessing, stores the results in the data/intermediate/
directory.  Once this is all done, we can apply our machine learning technique, output the
results in the data/output/ directory.  There's also a script to turn this data into SQLite
databases, to be used by PrediXcan.

This is a work-in-progress, but right now, you can enter an interactive qsub session,
go to the modelpipeline/scripts directory, and run ./make_all.py.  This will preprocess all the
data if necessary.  It gets messy towards the end because you need to exit the qsub session
to send off more qsub jobs, and then there still needs to be some kind of cron job to build the
databases once all of the models have been built with R.

See scripts/make_all.py to see the flow of the pipeline.  The end points of this script will have
to be broken up.
